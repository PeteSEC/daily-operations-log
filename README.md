# daily-operations-log
I working in security operations center (SOC) and we oversee many security professionals. I would like to automate daily activity logs. When an Officer does a routine check, break, or investigation, or other action it is logged within a spreadsheet. I want entrys to be very fast via dropdowns, checkboxes, autocomplete, etc. Also add features such as auto timestamp, most importantly each log would connect an Officer (and site) with their activity/time, and then add it to a daily log for each person/post. I would like the report to be published and have accountability/security as well. Other features could be added in to make more relations
